# Introduction

Pacman spends his life running from ghosts, but things were not always so. Legend has it that many years ago, Pacman's great grandfather Grandpac learned to hunt ghosts for sport. However, he was blinded by his power and could only track ghosts by their banging and clanging.

![Can Pacman live up to Grandpac's name and catch the ghosts?](https://github.com/ngbolin/PacManProjects/blob/master/images/busters.png)

For this assignment, we will be implementing the following methods and classes, and tackling the following problems:

1. Exact Inference (Filtering)
2. Exact Inference with Time Elapse (Filtering)
3. Exact Inference Full Test (Filtering)
4. Approximate Inference (Particle Filtering)
5. Approximate Inference with Time Elapse (Particle Filtering)
6. Joint Particle Filter Observation
7. Joint Particle Filter with Time Elapse
