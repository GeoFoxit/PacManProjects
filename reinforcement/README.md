# Introduction

In this project, you will implement value iteration and Q-learning. You will test your agents first on Gridworld (from class), then apply them to a simulated robot controller (Crawler) and Pacman.

![PacMan shall learn from his past failure to emerge victorious!](https://github.com/ngbolin/PacManProjects/blob/master/images/capsule.png)

These are the problems we will be working on:

1. Value Iteration
2. Bridge Crossing Analysis
3. Analysis of Policies
4. Q-Learning
5. Epsilon Greedy (Exploration vs Exploitation)
6. Bridge Crossing Analysis Revisited
7. Q-Learning and PacMan
8. Approximate Q-Learning
