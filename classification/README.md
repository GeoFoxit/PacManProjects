# Introduction

In this project, you will design three classifiers: a perceptron classifier, a large-margin (MIRA) classifier, and a slightly modified perceptron classifier for behavioral cloning. You will test the first two classifiers on a set of scanned handwritten digit images, and the last on sets of recorded pacman games from various agents. Even with simple features, your classifiers will be able to do quite well on these tasks when given enough training data.

What actions should we select?

For this assignment, we will be using the ideas from behavioural cloning to mimic various pacman agents by using recorded games as training examples. Your agent will then run the classifier at each action in order to try and determine which action would be taken by the observed agent. Here are the questions/concepts which we will be tackling:

1. Perceptron and Perceptron Analysis
2. MIRA (Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm
3. Digit Feature Design (Feature Creation and Selection)
4. Behavioural Cloning (with Perceptron)
5. Pacman Feature Design (Feature Creation and Selection)
