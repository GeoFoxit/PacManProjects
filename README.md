# Pac-Man Projects
As part of UC Berkeley's introductory Artificial Intelligence Course, CS 188, the Pac-Man projects were developed to help students understand the lesson material better. You can find more information on their [website](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html).

## Projects

There are 5 projects in total, each focusing on specific segments of the course:

[**Search**](https://github.com/ngbolin/pacman_projects/tree/master/search)

Students implement [depth-first](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search), [breadth-first](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search), [uniform cost](https://algorithmicthoughts.wordpress.com/2012/12/15/artificial-intelligence-uniform-cost-searchucs/), and [A* search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.


[**Multi-Agent Search**](https://github.com/ngbolin/pacman_projects/tree/master/multiagent)

Classic Pacman is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. Students implement multiagent [minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) and [expectimax](https://web.uvic.ca/~maryam/AISpring94/Slides/06_ExpectimaxSearch.pdf) algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.


[**Reinforcement Learning**](https://github.com/ngbolin/PacManProjects/tree/master/reinforcement)

Students implement model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, applied to the AIMA textbook's Gridworld, Pacman, and a simulated crawling robot.


**Ghostbusters**

Probabilistic inference in a [Hidden Markov Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model) tracks the movement of hidden ghosts in the Pacman world. Students implement exact inference using the forward algorithm and approximate inference via particle filters.


**Classification**

Students implement standard machine learning classification algorithms using Naive Bayes, Perceptron, and MIRA models to classify digits. Students extend this by implementing a behavioral cloning Pacman agent.
