# Introduction

In this project, your Pac-Man agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. You will build general search algorithms and apply them to Pac-Man scenarios.

For this assignment, we will be implementing the following Searches, and tackling the following problems:

1. Depth First Search (DFS)
2. Breadth First Search (BFS)
3. Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
4. A-Star Search
5. Corners Problem
6. Corners Problem: Heuristic
7. A-Star Food Search (Eating All Dots)
8. Suboptimal Search (ClosestDotSearch)
